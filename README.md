##Notes
- Code folding is dependent on properly formatted blocks of code. If the folding behaves erratic try reformatting the code
- A simple way of reformatting to facilitate folding is to have block start and end constructs in seperate individual lines
- A light color scheme works best (actually dark schemes don't show the markers at all) with this plugin, for now
